## Assignment 1: Refactor 

### Author: Andrew Moses

### Description:
In this assignment, I was tasked with refactoring the code for a webpage containing both HTML and CSS as part of a "User Story" exercise. The acceptance criteria included meeting accessibility standards (including alt image attributes), maintaining code structure/sequential order and semantic integrity within the HTML, and ensuring that descriptive title elements were present.

Along with meeting the minimum acceptance criteria, I made an effort to more cleanly format the HTML to make it more readable and accessible. I also took additional time to condense and simplify the CSS, while adding flex features to certain areas to improve the aesthetic features of the webpage, along with lasting functionality.

In an effort to increase my knowledge (especially in the realm of CSS/flex) I used this project as an opportunity to practice and troubleshoot, which has been very beneficial. Aside from getting a solid rep in of refactoring in general, this has given me good insight into one of the many things I could expect in the future, both in and out of the classroom.
